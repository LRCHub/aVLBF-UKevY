[00:18.44] Angie, Angie
[00:25.02] When will those clouds all disappear?
[00:43.52] 
[00:32.67] Angie, Angie
[00:39.88] Where will it lead us from here?
[00:55.88] 
[00:45.90] With no loving in our souls
[00:49.64] And no money in our coats
[00:54.20] You can't say we're satisfied
[01:00.77] Angie, Angie
[01:06.77] 
[01:08.66] You can't say we never tried
[01:22.66] 
[01:15.88] Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
[01:22.57] But ain't it time we said goodbye?
[01:39.57] 
[01:30.03] Angie
[01:33.20] I still love you
[01:41.20] 
[01:36.53] Remember all those nights we cried?
[01:42.00] All the dreams we held so close
[01:57.50] 
[01:45.22] Seemed to all go up in smoke
[01:50.13] Let me whisper in your ear
[01:56.24] Angie, Angie
[02:02.24] 
[02:03.54] Where will it lead us from here?
[02:19.54] 
[02:36.81] Oh, Angie, don't you weep
[02:40.16] All your kisses still taste sweet
[02:45.28] I hate that sadness in your eyes
[02:51.06] But, Angie, Angie
[02:59.56] 
[02:58.89] Ain't it time we said goodbye, yeah?
[03:16.89] 
[03:17.97] With no loving in our souls
[03:21.45] And no money in our coats
[03:26.38] You can't say we're satisfied
[03:32.34] But, Angie, I still love you, baby
[03:39.52] Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
[03:46.32] There ain't a woman that comes close to you
[03:53.38] Come on, baby, dry your eyes
[03:59.27] Angie, Angie
[04:06.84] Ain't it good to be alive?
[04:14.06] Angie, Angie
[04:20.55] They can't say we never tried
