Dear Angie, just these lines to confirm something you may know
Dear Angie, please excuse the writing, it's my nerves, you know
When you caught your train today
You took my heart and soul away
I can't wait 'til Friday night
To see you, touch you, hold you tight
Dear Angie, how's your folks and relatives?
I hope they're well
Dear Angie, I'm spending my vacation at that same hotel
I've known you now for one whole year
There's something I've not told you, dear
Turned a blind eye for too long
This letter proves that I've been wrong
Ba, ba, da, ooh
Ba, ba, da, ooh
I've known you now for one whole year
There's something I've not told you, dear
Turned a blind eye for too long
This letter proves that I've been wrong
Dear Angie, I've beat about the bush, it's time I spoke my mind
Dear Angie, It's been a long time coming, guess I've been unkind
Dear Angie, the writing's on the wall
Dear Angie, I love you, you're my all
Guess that's all
